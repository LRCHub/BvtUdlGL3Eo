Yes I, I am a nighthawk
Flying to the night
(Yes) in the dark I walk a tightrope
Though I never slip and fall
(That's OK)
In the clouds there is a nighthawk
Who can hear the midnight call
(Hear what I say)
And I know I can stand up on my own
(So to speak so to speak)
And I know I will never be alone
(There's more like me there's more like me)
Yes I, I am a nighthawk
Flying into the night
Yes I, I am a nighthawk
Flying to the night
(Yes) the sky is free like my spirit
And I am going all the way
(That's OK)
You can see but when you hear it
Senses tell you I don't bluff
(Hear what I say)
And I know I can stand up on my own
(So to speak so to speak)
And I know I will never be alone
There's no like me there's more like me

Yes I, I am a nighthawk
Flying into the night
Yes I, I am a nighthawk
Flying to the night
Yes I am a nighthawk
Flying into the night
Yes I, I am a nighthawk
Flying to the night
(Yes)

And I know I will never be alone
There's more like me
And I know I can stand up on my own
So to speak
And I know I can stand up on my own
(So to speak) so to speak
And I know I will never be alone
There's more like me there's more like me
Yes I, I am a nighthawk
Flying into the night
Yes I, I am a nighthawk
Flying to the night
Yes I am a nighthawk
Flying into the night
Yes I, I am a nighthawk
Flying to the night
