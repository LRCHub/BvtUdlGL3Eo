Times have changed
And we've often rewound the clock
Since the Puritans got a shock
When they landed on Plymouth Rock
If today, any shock they should try to stem
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock
Plymouth Rock would land on them

In olden days, a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
But now, God knows anything goes
Good authors too who once knew better words
Now only use four-letter words
Writing prose
Anything goes

If driving fast cars you like
If low bars you like
If old hymns you like
If bare limbs you like
If Mae West you like
Or me undressed you like
Why, nobody will oppose
When every night the set that's smart
Is intruding at nudist parties in studios
Anything goes

When the Missus Ned McLean, God bless her
Can get Russian reds to yes her
Then I suppose anything goes

When Rockefeller still can hoard enough money
To let Max Gordon produce his shows
Anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today
And black's white today
And day's night today
And that gent today
You gave a cent today
Once had several chateaux

When folks who still can ride in jitneys
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys
Lack baby clothes
Anything goes

When Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction
Then Nana shows
Anything goes

When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up
Now does a handspring landing upon her toes
Anything goes

Just think of those shocks you've got
And those knocks you've got
And those blues you've got
From those news you've got
And those pains you've got
If any brains you've got
From those little radios

So Missus R, with all her trimmin's
Can broadcast abed from Simmons
'Cause Franklin knows
Anything goes
