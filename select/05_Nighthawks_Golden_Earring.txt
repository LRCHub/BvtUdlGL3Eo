Every time when the night falls
I can feel my temperature risin'
Every time when the night calls
And the moon seems to be smilin'

Yeah, don't talk 'bout it
Just take your wings and fly
Yeah, don't worry 'bout it
We're all goin' flyin' tonight

(Nighthawks)
We can wing it on the wildest storm
(Nighthawks)
Baby, we're gonna dive in, dive in
(Nighthawks)

Ooh baby, like the night before
(Nighthawks)
Come on and watch the nighthawks flyin'
(Nighthawks)
Come on and watch the nighthawks flyin'
(Nighthawks)

Low down city in the rain
In the summertime
Don't it wanna make you cry
And die before your time, hey

(Nighthawks, nighthawks)
Every time when the night falls
(Nighthawks)
My baby gets sentimental
(Nighthawks)

Every time when the night calls
(Nighthawks)
And the mood gets temperamental
(Nighthawks)

Yeah, don't think about it
(Nighthawks)
Just shake your wings and fly
(Nighthawks)
Yeah, don't worry 'bout

No sign in your eyes of fatigue
You've been jailed before
Ride on the wind
You need more, more, more, more, more

(Nighthawks, nighthawks, nighthawks, nighthawks)
Let me tell you that a nighthawk is cryin'
(Nighthawks)
Don't cry like you know cryin'
(Nighthawks)

Let me tell you that a nighthawk is dyin'
(Nighthawks)
Don't die like you know dyin'
(Nighthawks)

Yeah, don't talk 'bout it
(Nighthawks)
Just shake your wings and fly
(Nighthawks)

Yeah, don't worry 'bout it
(Nighthawks)
We're all goin' flyin' tonight
(Nighthawks)
We're all goin' flyin' tonight
(Nighthawks)

Nighthawks, nighthawks
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Nighthawks
(La, la, la, la, la)
Nighthawks
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)

Nighthawks, nighthawks
Nighthawks, nighthawks
Nighthawks, nighthawks
