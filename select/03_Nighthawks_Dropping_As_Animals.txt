In this soft and quiet street
I saw a walking, roaming man
Does he have a mission?
Does he have a home
His road seems so haunted
By the the lack of what he had
He's just a man destroyed and sad

Pre over and over again
I look at the seeds
He left behind
As a gift he sent to me
Respectfully he tried to find his place to be
Under the sun ascending, on the deepest morning

Ooh keep eyes open see nighthawks dropping
Ooh keep eyes open see nighthawks dropping
Ooh keep arms wide open catch the nighthawks dropping

Just loneliness as a friend
In this dark and empty space
And the crowd which grows now
Millions of birds, millions of souls
Chasing away the boredom
Close your eyes and see them fly away

Pre over and over again
I look at the seeds
He left behind
As a gift he sent to me
Respectfully he tried to find his place to be
Under the sun ascending, on the deepest morning

Ooh keep eyes open see nighthawks dropping
Ooh keep eyes open see nighthawks dropping
Ooh keep arms wide open catch the nighthawks dropping.
