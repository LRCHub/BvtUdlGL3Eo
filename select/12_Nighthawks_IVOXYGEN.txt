Sitting at the table
I'm gon' fade away
With my cup and the phone
Yea, what's up, I wanna know

It's scenery to die for
Big city, big pyro
We are little bit of psycho
Running in the circles
It's the 7 in my head (It's the 7 in my head)
Everybody in here so calm
So far from the sincere

I don't feel so stable
Ey-eyes like the ocean
Liquor in my stomach
Everything is a motion

I don't wanna think about tomorrow no
I don't wanna think about tomorrow no

It's so easily to fall for
Big love, big mind, oh
We are little bit of psycho
Running in the circles
It's the 7 in my head (It's the 7 in my head)

It's the scenery to die for
Big city, big pyro
Wе are little bit of psycho
Running in the cyclеs
It's the 7 in my head (It's the 7 in my head)

I look at the people
And the people look at me
In this place we all know how we feel (how we feel)
And it's deal and it's deal
With the demon it's so real
And they steal
And they steal
All our souls is a meal
We will heal
We will heal
Yeah yeah yeah
We will heal
We will heal
Yeah yeah yeah

Everybody in here so calm
So far from the sincere

It's scenery to die for
Big city, big pyro
We are little bit of psycho
Running in the cycles
It's the 7 in my head
It's the 7 in my head
